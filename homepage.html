      <p>Welcome to the Edinburgh University Yoga Society website.</p>

      <p>As a committee we aim to make yoga as inexpensive and accessible as we can for
      our members (both students and non-students). We offer a variety of classes and
      workshops in a variety of locations in Edinburgh throughout the year. See our
      timetable page for more information!</p>

      <p>If you have a question (and it has not answered on the <a href=
      "http://euyogasoc.com/faq/">FAQ</a> page) or would like to get involved (we always
      need more help!) then please contact us.</p>

      <p>Namaste.</p>
